Your README file should have a brief description of your program design
 and data structure design, the breakdown of the files, a summary of what you think works and fails in your program,
 which programming language and compiler version you used, and information on how to run your program.
 
 Program Design:
 Here in this project I have created two separate files for Encoder class in com.encoder package
 and Decoder class in com.decoder package which has encoding and decoding logic respectively.
 Additionally I have also created a helper class named UtilityHelper which has some static methods which are used in Encoder 
 and Decoder classes in order to convert the output into expected form.
 
 Data structure design:
 Here I have used Hashmap to store the ASCII Characters. As hashMap retrieves in O(1) time I felt this data structure suits well
 in this scenario.
 
 Breakdown of the files:
 For Encoder class the input ASCII text file path along with bit length is sent as part of command line arguments and the output of the
 Encoder class i.e., generated .lzw file is passed as input to Decoder class in command line arguments.
 
  A summary of what you think works and fails in your program:
  If the file path along with bit lengths are given correctly in the command line arguments then the two files both 
  Encoder and Decoder will run successfully and converts the given input into encoded form and later decodes it.
  If we fail to provide either file paths / bitlength in command line arguments then both the classes throw 
  java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.
  
  Programming language Used: Java
  
  Compiler Version: Java8
